1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We have made a conscious effort to align
our definition of our territory and our

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
maritime zones with what international
law permits and recognises.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This has been inscribed in Article one
of our Constitution.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A Senator I was proud to co-sponsor our
archipelagic baselines law, which

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
defines the basis of our maritime
jurisdictions.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
As President, I look forward to signing
our Maritime Zones law, which will

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
clarify the geographic extent of our
maritime domain.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Our efforts stand in stark contrast to
assertive actions that aim to propagate

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
excessive and baseless claims through
force intimidation and deception in the

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
West Philippine Sea.
We are on the front lines of efforts to

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
assert the integrity of the interests of
the constitution of the oceans.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We have defined our territory and
maritime zones in a manner befitting a

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
responsible and law abiding member of
the international community.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We have submitted our assertions to
rigorous legal scrutiny by the world's

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
leading jurists.
So the lies that we draw in our waters

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
are not derived from just our
imagination, but from international law.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have on our side the 1982 laws and
the binding 2006 arbitral award, which

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
affirms what is ours by legal right.
In our in this solid footing and through

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
our clear moral ascendancy, we find the
strength to do whatever it takes to

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
protect our sovereign home to the last
square inch, to the last square

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
millimeter, the life giving waters of
the West Philippine Sea flow in the

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
blood of every Filipino.
We cannot allow anyone to detach it from

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the totality of the maritime domain that
renders our nation whole.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
As president, I have sworn to this
solemn commitment from the very first

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
day that I took office.
I do not intend to yield.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Filipinos do not yield.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not only

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
unyielding in protecting our patrimony,
our rights and our dignity as a proud

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and as a free country.
We are also firm in our commitment to

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
regional and global peace.
We renew this commitment at this

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
turbulent juncture of our history.
I repeat what I said at the United

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Nations almost two years ago Amidst
challenging global tides and important

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ballast stabilizes our common vessel,
our open, inclusive and rules based

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
international order is governed by
international law and informed by the

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
principles of equity and of justice.
